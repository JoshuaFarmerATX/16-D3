          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Income and Healthcare and Obesity</h2>
          <p>There appears to be an overal increase in obesity with lower income. Perhaps this is due to lower quality, less healthy food being
            more affordable. This could also be part of the reason that healthcare costs are increased in lower income states as well, though not
            to the same degree.  Additionally, some states such as West Virginia change dramatically between Healthcare and Obesity. While they are 
            fairly low on the healthcare scale, they are very high on the obesity scale. </p>
